### Personal Projects Worth Mentioning

Some of my personal projects that show my skills with my tech stack.

- [meli-challenge](https://github.com/victorrenop/meli-challenge): PySpark and graphs to solve a characters interaction problem
- [black-crow-ai-challenge](https://github.com/victorrenop/black-crow-ai-challenge): data quality and transformation on unstructured data using PySpark and Great Expectations
- [raven](https://github.com/victorrenop/raven): config manager API using Go and Gin

### Stuff That I Did in College

Some projects on computer engineering, software engineering and machine learning. The code quality and organization might be a bit lacking (or not present at all üòÖ), but these were projects that brought a lot of value to me in terms of general computer engineering/science knowledge.

- [software-testing](https://github.com/victorrenop/software-testing): repo with TDD exercises and projects for the Software Testing class
- [neural-networks](https://github.com/victorrenop/software-testing): repo with neural networks projects for the Neural Networks class
- [algorithm-analysis](https://github.com/victorrenop/algorithm-analysis-final-assignment): repo with my final project for the Algorithm Analysis class. Used multiple data structures and implemented a simple map reduce then benchmarked everything to see what was the fastest approach for a sum group by aggregation.
- [MIPS-Single-Cycle-in-Verilog](https://github.com/victorrenop/MIPS-Single-Cycle-in-Verilog): a complete MIPS processor written in Verilog and designed for FPGAs. This project was developed by me during most of my college time and spanned multiple computer engineering classes where I developed the initial architecture, instruction set, custom language support and external communication support. With this architecture, I was able to run my custom OS, with my custom language (a C clone with the basic keywords) and communicate with an Arduino for external storage and network communication.
